# Procedural World Generation in the flesh

Procedural world generation is the process of generating a game's world
based on a set of procedures. Many games use procedural world generation
to give players a unique experience each playthrough.
Below are some examples of games that use procedural world generation.

[_Rogue_](https://www.mobygames.com/game/rogue) is a DOS game from 1980.
In _Rogue_, players explore the Dungeon
of Doom. The player starts at the top level of the dungeon, going deeper into
the dungeon to find the Amulet of Yendor. The entire dungeon is procedurally
generated so each run of the game is a new experience.
