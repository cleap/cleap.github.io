Here are some examples of games that use procedural world generation.

## Rogue

[_Rogue_](https://www.mobygames.com/game/rogue) is a DOS game from 1980.
In _Rogue_, players explore the Dungeon
of Doom. The player starts at the top level of the dungeon, going deeper into
the dungeon to find the Amulet of Yendor. The entire dungeon is procedurally
generated so each run of the game is a new experience.

## The Binding of Isaac

[_The Binding of Isaac_](https://bindingofisaac.com/) is an indie game by
Edmund McMillen. It belongs to
a genre of games heavily inspired by _Rogue_ called roguelikes. In
_The Binding of Isaac_, the player also fights their way through procedurally
generated floors, going deeper into the dungeon to reach the final Boss.
