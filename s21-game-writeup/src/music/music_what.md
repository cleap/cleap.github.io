# What Can Procedural Music Do?

Procedural music allows the music of the game to adapt to the gameplay. In
the simplest case, games like [Pokemon Red](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-red-version-and-pokemon-blue-version/)
change music depending on what town or route the player is on and whether the
player is in battle. Other games, like [Audiosurf 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/235800/Audiosurf_2/)
go the opposite direction and adapt the gameplay to whatever music the player
provides.
