# How We Used Procedural Music

For our exploration into procedural music, we decided to look at layering
different parts of songs together to form procedural compositions. We chose
4 different songs: [_Crab Rave_ by Noisestorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDU_Txk06tM),
[_Il vento d'oro_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MtOpB5LlUA) from
_Jojo's Bizarre Adventure_,
[Smash Mouth's _All Star_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_jWHffIx5E),
and the jazz meme, [_The Lick_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krDxhnaKD7Q).

For each piece, we arranged different melodies, harmonies, and percussion parts
on different instruments. The procedural music player selected different
instrumentations at random to produce a procedural composition of each piece.
This can be used to adapt different instrumentations of a game's theme to
different events in the game.
